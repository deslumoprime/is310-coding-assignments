### **4. AI Tool/Workflow**

AI will primarily be used to guide the learning process. For example, Git is an annoying beast of a tool with a rather steep learning curve, and at times, it can seem impossible to figure out. GenAI will be used to make Git things a bit faster. 

Code debugging is another avenue where genAI will help a lot. Simply informing what's wrong fundamentally in the code is enough for me to get it fixed. 

*I love doing the things that I do, and letting genAI do it for me takes away from the fun.* 

I use ChatGPT almost exclusively, as I've found that it gives me workable results from my $20$ USD per month subscription for software, math, as well as humanities classes.
