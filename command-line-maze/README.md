I have an artist in mind! Unfortunately, the baby seems to have eaten the papers containing this artist's name. The baby has upchucked the papers a mere 5 minutes after consumption but they seem to be jumbled up among the other things that the baby ate. Additionally, we are unsure whether this baby has eaten the information we are interested in or if the baby has simply hidden it somewhere in his dormitories. 

The first thing you should do is to clean up the baby's mess. Good luck!
