You now become suspicious of this "baby" you're dealing with. Perhaps the order in which you're finding these clues is actually intentionally created by the baby. 

The baby hears you. He seems to appear to understand. 

You inquire: "Are you actually a baby?" 

He responds: "I'm a dangerous ------. With some money in my pocket."

"What?"

"I'm a man, not a baby, not a toddler, not a teenager, not an adult. Eight lettersssss...."
